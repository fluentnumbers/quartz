# [[perplexity]]
<sub>scroll ↓ to [[#Resources]]</sub>
## Note
- Intrinsic [[LLM]] evaluation method: a geometric average of the inverse probability of words predicted by the model.
- Intuitively, perplexity means *to be surprised*. We measure how much the model is surprised by seeing new data. **The lower the perplexity, the better the training is**.
- Another common measure is the [[cross-entropy]], which is the Logarithm (base 2) of perplexity.
- As a thumb rule, a reduction of 10-20% in perplexity is noteworthy.
