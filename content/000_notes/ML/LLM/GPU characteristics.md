# [[GPU characteristics]]
<sub>scroll ↓ to [[#Resources]]</sub>

## Note
- **Peak FLOPs**: indicates the maximum number of floating-point operations a GPU can perform per second when all its compute engines are fully utilized.. The value depends on the precision of the model's weight (e.g. 32, 16 or 8 bits).
- **GPU memory size**: the total amount of memory available on the GPU. It is where LLMs store all their data.
- **GPU memory bandwidth**: the maximum speed at which data can be transferred (read or write) between the compute engine (or CUDA cores) and the GPU memory
