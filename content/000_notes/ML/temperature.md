## Note
- parameter of the [[softmax]] function, when the base formula is modified so that the exponent is divided by a value T

![[assets/published/Untitled.png|500]]

- with T --> infinity it increases [[entropy]] and flattens the distribution
- with T--> 0: more confident predictions become even more confident, less confident become even less confident

- this property allows controlling for diversity, creativity and consistency of tokens and is widely adopted by LLM [[decoding strategy|decoding strategies]]
