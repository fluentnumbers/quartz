# [[Gated Linear Unit]]

## Note
- Gated Linear Units [Dauphin et al., 2016] consist of the component-wise product of two linear projections, one of which is first passed through a sigmoid function. Variations on GLU are possible, using different nonlinear (or even linear) functions in place of sigmoid.
- **Gated** means that there is a component responsible for letting signal through. Most often that is achieved by multiplying a signal by a number from 0 to 1.

## SwiGLU
- used in [[paper review - Llama 3 Herd of Models]] as well as Llama 2
- is a combination of [[Gated Linear Unit|GLU]] and Swish

- *swish* with component-wise multiplication of another feed-forward layer
	- [[sigmoid]] inside [[swish]] acts as a *gate*

#### Why does it work?
> We offer no explanation as to why these architectures seem to work; we attribute their success, as all else, to divine benevolence.
