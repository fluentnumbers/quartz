## Note
- regularization is used to regulate model complexity and help fight [[overfitting]] or [[multicollinearity]]
- it leads to increasing the error on the **training set** and decreasing the error on the validation set
- there are methods, which <font color="#00b050">modify the [[loss function]]</font> and the ones, which modify data like [[data augmentation]]

## Regularization for shallow models
- [[normalization]] is required for most algorithms

### Methods
[[regularization exc.excalidraw#^group=MP9PVHo5T4IVp6sDvHxof]]
![[regularization exc.excalidraw.svg|500]]
- λ is a [[hyperparameters|hyperparameter]] and needs to be adjusted from experiments
- Minimizing the sum of two functions
#### Lasso (L1)
- [[Lasso]] (L1) - punishes non-zero coefficients --> some coefficients go to 0

#### Ridge
- [[Ridge]] (L2) - punishes large coefficients --> makes model robust to small changes in input data, well differentiable
 - Minimization task becomes a sum of the loss function and the squared weights:

- Minimizing the above yields the solution for weights **w**:

#### ElasticNet
- [[ElasticNet]] (L1+L2)
